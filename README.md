The Yoshikoder is a simple cross-platform multilingual content analysis program.  You can use it to count words, create and apply content analysis dictionaries, highlight documents, and look at keywords in context.

## Resources

You can find some dictionary and other resources at the [old place](http://yoshikoder.sourceforge.net/resources.html).

## Installation

To install, choose a version from the [releases page](https://github.com/conjugateprior/yoshikoder/releases) appropriate for your operating system.  Mac users without Java 1.8+ installed, or who just want to be sure should choose the 'bundled' version.

## Bugs

If you run into a bug you can tell me about it [here](https://github.com/conjugateprior/yoshikoder/issues).

## News

There's not much new lately as I'm working on R packages for text analysis instead.  Mostly [Quanteda](https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) and [Austin](https://conjugateprior.github.io/austin).

## Citation

If youâ€™d like to refer to the package in written work (and you should) you can use this:
