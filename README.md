The Yoshikoder is a cross-platform multilingual content analysis
program developed as part of the [Identity
Project](http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/misc/initiative/identity) at
[Harvard](http://www.harvard.edu)'s [Weatherhead Center for
International Affairs](http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu).

You can load documents, construct and apply content analysis
dictionaries, examine keywords-in-context, and perform basic content
analyses, in any language. About two laptops ago it looked like this:

The Yoshikoder works with text documents, whether in plain ASCII,
[Unicode](http://www.unicode.org) (e.g. UTF-8), or national encodings
(e.g. Big5 Chinese.) You can construct, view, and save
keywords-in-context. You can write content analysis
dictionaries. Yoshikoder provides summaries of documents, either as
word frequency tables or according to a content analysis
dictionary. You can also apply a dictionary analysis to the results of
a concordance, which provides a flexible way to study local word
contexts. Yoshikoder's native file format is XML, so dictionaries and
keyword-in-context files are non-proprietary and human readable.

## Resources

You can find some dictionaries and other resources at the
[old homepage](http://yoshikoder.sourceforge.net/resources.html).

## Installation

To install, choose a version from the [releases page](https://github.com/conjugateprior/yoshikoder/releases) appropriate for your operating system.  Mac users without Java 1.8+ installed, or who just want to be sure should choose the 'bundled' version.

## Bugs

If you run into a bug you can tell me about it [here](https://github.com/conjugateprior/yoshikoder/issues).

## News

There's not much new lately as I'm working on R packages for text analysis instead.  Mostly [Quanteda](https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) and [Austin](https://conjugateprior.github.io/austin).
