![Screenshot of Yoshikoder](http://conjugateprior.org/wp-content/uploads/screenshot1.png)

The Yoshikoder is a simple cross-platform multilingual content analysis program.  You can use it to count words, create and apply content analysis dictionaries, highlight documents, and look at keywords in context.

## Installation

To install, choose a version from the [releases page](https://github.com/conjugateprior/yoshikoder/releases) appropriate for your operating system.  Mac users without Java 1.8+ installed, or who just want to be sure should choose the 'bundled' version.

## Bugs

If you run into a bug you can tell me about it [here](http://github.com/conjugateprior/yoshikoder/issues).

## News

There's not much new lately as I'm mostly working on R packages for text analysis, most recently [Quanteda](http://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) and [Austin](http://github.com/conjugateprior/austin)).
