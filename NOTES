Compiling
---------

If you've got [`launch4j`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/) and 
Infinitekind's fork of Oracle's [`appbundler`](https://bitbucket.org/infinitekind/appbundler)
installed, then change the paths in `build.xml` to where you put them and type:

    ant dist

to create a jar file, a Mac application and its disk image, and a Windows executable.

The ant task `jar` requires neither of these extras.
