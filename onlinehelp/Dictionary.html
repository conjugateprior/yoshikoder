  <h1 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h1>
  <p>Yoshikoder projects can have an associated content analysis dictionary. A dictionary is a tree structure of categories each of which may contain patterns. Patterns are strings that can match single words in a document. Categories simply organize them.</p>
  <h2 id="working-with-categories-and-patterns">Working with categories and patterns</h2>
  <p>You can add, edit and remove categories and patterns using <strong>Dictionary&gt;Add Category</strong> and <strong>Dictionary&gt;Add Pattern</strong> <strong>Dictionary&gt;Edit Entry</strong> and <strong>Dictionary&gt;Remove Entry</strong>, or by using the toolbar icons. You can also move categories and patterns around the dictionary by drag and drop.</p>
  <h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2>
  <p>Patterns may contain the wildcard character <code>*</code> which means 'zero or more other letters'. Hence <code>shout*</code> matches 'shout', 'shouting' and 'shouted'. The star can appear in any part of the string.</p>
  <p>Matching is <em>not</em> case sensitive, so 'Shout' and 'shout' both match the pattern <code>shout</code>.</p>
  <p>Although patterns cannot be duplicated within a category, wildcarding may nevertheless allow double counting. You can check for this by using the highlighting and concordance functions.</p>
  <h2 id="adding-many-patterns">Adding many patterns</h2>
  <p>If you already have a list of patterns you need to import you can select a category in the dictionary and use the text are offered by <strong>Dictionary&gt;Add Patterns</strong> to insert them all in one go. This is more efficient than using <strong>Dictionary&gt;Add Pattern</strong>. Each white separated string you provide in the entry field will be treated like a potential pattern and added, unless it duplicates an entry already in the category. You can always remove the entries you don't want afterwards.</p>
  <h2 id="opening-and-saving-existing-dictionaries">Opening and saving existing dictionaries</h2>
  <p>Dictionaries can be saved and loaded independently of projects using <strong>Dictionary&gt;Open</strong> and <strong>Dictionary&gt;Save As</strong>. When you open a new dictionary it replaces the old one, so don't forget to save a copy. <strong>Dictionary&gt;Open</strong> supports two dictionary formats: native and VBPro:</p>
  <p>The native Yoshikoder dictionary format is signalled by files ending in '.ykd'. Browsers sometimes also append '.xml' for some reason but you can remove that.</p>
  <p>The VBPro format is a a very simple flat dictionary specification format which surrounds category names with '&gt;&gt;' and '&lt;&lt;' and lists patterns one per line. For example:</p>
  <pre><code>  &gt;&gt;Fruit&lt;&lt;
  pear
  tomato
  &gt;&gt;Vegetables&lt;&lt;
  carrot
  potato</code></pre>
  <p>represents a two category dictionary with four patterns. Hierarchical structure cannot be represented in this format.</p>
  <p>VBPro is designed so that it is easy to construct dictionaries manually in a text editor.</p>
